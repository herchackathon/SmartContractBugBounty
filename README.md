![HERC](https://github.com/anthemgold/brand-assets/herclogo.png)
Security is a top priority for Hercules. To make sure the protocol stays secure we are officially launching a Bug Bounty program, starting now.
We are very pleased to let you know that the Hercules smart contracts have successfully been audited by Trusted Ledger Solutions, prior to main net launch. In both occasions, no major vulnerabilities have been found, but some minor errors still occur occassionaly .
Now that the audits have been completed, we are launching a bug bounty program. The bug bounty currently targets the eight separate smart contracts listed below. The branch to audit is master.

# Scope 
> - https://github.com/HERCone/contracts/tree/master/assetTracking

All Smart Contracts can be found at https://github.com/hercone

Critical vulnerabilities will be rewarded up to $5,000 USD equivalent in HERC tokens upon launch

## Rules & Rewards
` The rules of our bug bounty program are the same that apply to the Ethereum protocol: https://bounty.ethereum.org`
`Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to the Hercules team are not eligible for bounty rewards unless a direct fix is applied.`

`Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty.`
`The Hercules core development team, employees, and all other people directly paid by Hercules SEZC, directly or indirectly, are not eligible for rewards.`
`The Hercules bounty program considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to rewards are at the sole and final discretion of the Hercules SEZC bug bounty panel.`
`The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on severity. The severity is calculated according to the OWASP risk rating model based on Impact and Likelihood :`
